Awakened at 5:15 am. My eyes were embarassed by the sunbeams—turned my back to them and tried to take another dip into oblivion—succeeded—awakened at 7 a.m. thought of Mina, Daisy, and Mamma G——■put all 3 in my mental kaledescope to obtain a new combination a la Galton. took Mina as a basis, tried to improve her beauty by discarding and adding certain features borrowed from Daisy and Mamma G. a sort of Raphaelized beauty, got into it too deep, mind flew away and I went to sleep again. Awakened at 8:15 am. Poweful itching of my head, lots of white dry dandruff— what is this d—mnable material. Perhaps it is the dust from the dry literary matter I've crowded into my noddle lately■Its nomadic. gets all over my coat, must read about it in the Encyclopedia. Smoking too much makes me nervous—must lasso my natural tendency to acquire such habits—holding heavy cigar constantly in my mouth has deformed my upper lip, it has sort of a Havanna curl. Arose at 9 oclock came down stairs expecting twas too late for breakfast—twas'nt. could'nt eat much, nerves of stomach too nicotinny. The roots of tobacco plants must go clear through to hell. Satans principal agent Dyspepsia must have charge of this branch of the vegitable kingdom.— It has just occured to me that the brain may digest certain portions of the food, say the etherial part, as well as the stomach—perhaps dandruff is the excreta of the mind—the quantity of this material being directly proportional to the amount of reading one indulges in. A book on German metaphysics would thus easily ruin a dress suit. After breakfast start reading Hawthorne's English Note Book dont think much of it.— perhaps Im a literary barbarian and am not eyet educated up to the point of appreciating fine writing— 90 per cent of his book is descriptive of old churches and graveyards and coronors— He and Geo Selwyn ought to have been appointed perpetual coroners of London.

_Girl with a Pearl Earring_ (Dutch: Meisje met de parel) is an oil painting by Dutch Golden Age painter Johannes Vermeer, 
dated c. 1665. Going by various names over the centuries, it became known by its present title towards the end of the 
20th century after the earring worn by the girl portrayed there.[^1]
